# Netflix-ReactProject

Created a react project, which contains my top favourite 5 Netflix show. This project was created as part of learning ReactJS.

1. ReactJS
2. VS Code
3. AWS Amplify
4. HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JSX

I deployed this project on AWS and the link is: https://master.d31wujggzkk4vd.amplifyapp.com/
